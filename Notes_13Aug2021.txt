First activity in portal
	POD leader creates a project in tekstac
	in gtekstac you have option to go to GitLab

	project name in portal. Name convention?
	AttendanceMarking_INTADM21AJ028_POD1
	ELearningManagement_INTADM21AJ028_POD2


do not go to gitlab.com and signup or login.....THAT IS NOT CORRECT METHOD

Project is secret. This project should not be uploaded in GITHUB	

project is uploaded only in gitlab

in GITHUB you do not login as cognizant user (cognizant email)
	in github whatever we do is unofficial, use only personal email in GITHUB

forget git hub


From tekstac, we should login to gitlab	CORRECT

IN GIT LAB
	i am going to create the Milestone	(sprint1, sprint2)		each is for 5 days
	MONDAY - FRIDAY 	is one sprint		

	Our sprint1 starts on monday 16-Aug-2021. So today, we are supposed to create the project in portal and push empty project in gitlab.

in git lab,
	username	is cognizant	email id		WITHOUT @cognizant.com
	password is always		Tekno@1234

in spring tool suite
	create a spring boot starter project using spring initializer

follow the convention for
	group id
	artifact id
	package name

each project is a microservice	so 	"user-service"



in sprint1, FOCUS ON BASIC FUNCTIONALITY OF THE PROJECT
	EACH INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS TO BE CREATED
	if user enters data correctly, it is submitted

in sprint2, FOCUS on 
	VALIDATION
	NAVIGATION
	TESTING
	PWD ENCRYPTION
	OTP VALIDATION





git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M jag
git remote add origin https://github.com/jagasia/ams.git
git push -u origin jag





angular project contains "node_modules" folder which is around 50k files. WE dont want push this to remote repo
so what to do?
	NO NEED TO WORRY
	Whenever we create angular project, it automatically, adds .gitignore file that contains what to ignore.
so just push from local repo to remote repo


how to push angular project into that repository
	if you try, you will get error.


https://github.com/jagasia/ams

the POD leader push a empty project

whenever each member try to push their code, 
	problem occurs, if any other members have pushed some code which is not present in your local system

1) empty project
2) piyush push some files
3) arun want to push some files.	Problem is?
	Arun do not have the files pushed by piyush.
	So what error he will get

	what error Arun gets?
		Remote repository contains work that you do not have locally
		git pull before push

	git pull
		this is also a command to pull 
		but when there are many branches,
	git pull https://github.com/jagasia/ams.git piyush


what is the difference between:
	git clone
	git pull


git clone downloads the entire repository. 	If repository is 10 MB, you are downloading 10 MB
git pull pulls only the incremental change found in the remote to reflect it in the local repository
	it will not download all the 10 MB	only the changes are downloaded


git clone https://github.com/jagasia/ams.git

first time only we clone

next time onwards
git remote add origin https://github.com/jagasia/ams.git
git pull
or
	git pull https://github.com/jagasia/ams.git piyush



git merge jag --allow-unrelated-histories




git init
git add .
git commit -m "second commit"
git branch -M jag
git remote add origin git https://github.com/jagasia/ams.git
git push -u origin jag




if problem

del .git				y/n 		means 	y		(windows)
rmdir .git			



Milestone
	sprint1

in each milestone
	we create "issues"		means tasks

	issue
		allocated to "piyush"
	


sprint 1
	issue1		user module		allocated to Piyush
