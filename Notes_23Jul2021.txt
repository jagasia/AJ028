To create a repository in git hub
invite collaborators
clone a repository to local repo	(any folder where you have "git init" this will create a file .git which is invisible. You can delete it using 		rm in linux	del in windows		del .git)

clone is used only the first time when we download a repo from remote (git hub) to local

after some time, if any changes found in the remote repo,
we can pull incremental changes happened there to local

if we have done some changes in local repository, we can
	push the changes to the remote repository

if any collaborator has pushed some files to remote repo,
	we can pull and infact merge it to our local repo

JQuery
-------
	if i ask how many of you know javascript. 
	JQuery is an application of javascript.
		that means, any js syntax is allowed in the jquery program
		document.getElementById
		alert
		var age=20;
			all these js code are allowed in jquery

	<script src="file.js">			.js for jquery also

	in html
		<script>
		</script>
	you can have any number of <script> tags in a html file
		either in <head> or <body> or both

	if <script> tag is in <head> portion
	and <body> has text boxes,
		then how can the script access the textboxes as they are not even loaded while script is loaded
	so we need to check a condition, if document is ready, then only...

Lab setup:
----------
	in a computer what i should do to write jquery programs?
		nothing to install
	jquery.js 
		1) create a file jquery.js and paste the CDN code there
		or
		2) refer to the cdn directly

	<script src="jquery.js">		means, this file is present in the same folder as html file
	
	

<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.js">
</script>



when it should happen
	event
what should happen
	event handler
where 
	source or destination
		button
		textbox



$()			selector
			here, we specify the event source
			the object that cause event
	
$(document).ready();	
			ready is the event
$(document).ready(function(){});	
			the function is the event handler

	




	function fn1()
        {
            alert("this is fn1");
        }

        $(document).ready(fn1);

the above is same as


        $(document).ready(function(){	alert("this is fn1");		});

	here, the function() is anonymous function that do not have a name
	this function is useful here only. we cannot call anywhere else

javascript	vs	jquery

innerHTML	=	html()
innertText	=	text()
value		=	val()



1) lab setup
2) selectors
		$("p")				p is a paragraph. Here, we are using "Element" selector
		$("#p1")			p1 is the id of an element. Here we use "ID" selector
		$(".p2")			p2 is the class of an element. Here we use "class" selector

	there are more selectors like pseudo selectors, expression 



set up your env
	1) refer to jquery cdn
	2) use local jquery.js
	3) go to https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/
		go to chapter name "Selectors"
		identify various methods of using selectors.	Try it yourself
