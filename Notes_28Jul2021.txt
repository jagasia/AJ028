Bootstrap
---------
	what is bootstrap?
		somebody has created lot of 
			css
			jquery
		code and given us as bootstrap

remember, we created an example

whenever cursor enters a textbox, it is highlighted
when it leaves the textbox, highlight is removed

we can save that jquery coding in a separate file


in 1st stage you learnt css
------------------------------
do you know that we can create a css file separately and refer it in a html file?

how can i refer css file in a html file?



Conclusion:
	if there are 
		.css
		.js
	files, we can refer them in our html file and get benefit

how to use bootstrap in our html file?
	like we reference
		.css
		.js
	we do the same way, we reference bootstrap also in our html file

	bootstrap.css
	bootstrap.js
	jquery.js


scaffholding

in jquery also, in css also
	#	for ID
	.	for class

css
	.btn
	{
		color:green;
	}
		

<input type="button" class="btn" />




When bootstrap is applied to a html file,
	it impacts in the appearance of every element
	this is called as Typography

in bootstrap.css there are lot of styles applied using class
	.btn
	.btn-success
	

red green blue		combination is used for getting any color
	000		red, green, blue all are zero			BLACK
	fff		all are highest value				WHITE

	f00		red			
	0f0		green
	00f		blue
	555		grey scale			all red, green, blue are equal means grey scale




do you know the difference between
	div 	&	span


can we place 3 <div> in one line?


bootstrap treats a web page as 12 columns

.row
.col-xx-xx
	col-md-4
	col-sm-2
	



bootstrap grid
	12 columns
	typography


Responsive Web Design
	when user views the website from mobile, laptop, desktop
	the screen width is different and browsers can be resized
	the RWD adapts to the width
	
	Bootstrap is Mobile-first approach
