First activity in portal
	POD leader creates a project in tekstac
	in gtekstac you have option to go to GitLab

	project name in portal. Name convention?
	AttendanceMarking_INTADM21AJ028_POD1
	ELearningManagement_INTADM21AJ028_POD2


do not go to gitlab.com and signup or login.....THAT IS NOT CORRECT METHOD

Project is secret. This project should not be uploaded in GITHUB	

project is uploaded only in gitlab

in GITHUB you do not login as cognizant user (cognizant email)
	in github whatever we do is unofficial, use only personal email in GITHUB

forget git hub


From tekstac, we should login to gitlab	CORRECT

IN GIT LAB
	i am going to create the Milestone	(sprint1, sprint2)		each is for 5 days
	MONDAY - FRIDAY 	is one sprint		

	Our sprint1 starts on monday 16-Aug-2021. So today, we are supposed to create the project in portal and push empty project in gitlab.

in git lab,
	username	is cognizant	email id		WITHOUT @cognizant.com
	password is always		Tekno@1234

	EACH INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS TO BE CREATED
	if user enters data correctly, it is submitted

in sprint2, FOCUS on 
	VALIDATION
	NAVIGATION

git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M jag
git remote add origin https://github.com/jagasia/ams.git
git push -u origin jag





angular project contains "node_modules" folder which is around 50k files. WE dont want push this to remote repo
so what to do?
	NO NEED TO WORRY
	Whenever we create angular project, it automatically, adds .gitignore file that contains what to ignore.
so just push from local repo to remote repo
