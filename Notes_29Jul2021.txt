1) scaffholding
	provides basic structure of the website.
	logo
	banners
	login/logout
	Menu
	Components
	table of contents
	a cards of products

Let us create a sample website using bootstrap
	CARDS
	navbar
	jumbotron
	

Lets see what is card?
	is like a box
	that contains
		an image
		Title
		description
		Price
		Button		"Add to cart"	or	"Buy Now"	or More info

	wherever in the card, i click, the button should be clicked "Stretched Link"

	in bootstrap, just learn what object with which "class" this combination


1) in-line			
2) internal
3) external

in-line
	<p style="color:red" >This is a para</p>

internal		(in the same page)
	<style>
		p
		{
			color:red;
		}
	</style>

external		(the css file is referred			.css)
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="one.css">

if i have all of these in a page??????
	which one will apply?

	in-line wins		whatever we specify in line that only applies

if inline is not there,
	internal will apply

if internal is not there,
	then only external style will apply
