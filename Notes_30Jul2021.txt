creating components
--------------------
	what is a component in angular?
	a component can be plugged into any other components or module
	a component
		template			html
		style				css
		code				ts
		unit test			spec.ts		(karma jasmine unit test code)


if you see the .ts file
	class AppComponent
		that is decorated by @Component decorator is a component

	@Component		is called as annotation in java. but "decorator" in typescript

in today's demo:
-----------------
1) create a project "july30"
	with routing
	style=css
2) a login component
3) plug it in app component
4) if username and password are 
	root
	rootuser
		
		then login is successful, else failure
5) use bootstrap for scaffolding


To create a component:
	ng g c login					here, login is the component name
							g for generate, c for component
	ng generate component login
	ng g component login

		login.component.html
		login.component.css
		login.component.ts
		login.component.spec.ts				we dont use this	karma jasmine unit testing
 

SPA
	Single Page Application
		index.html

all the components are plugged in index.html
	i suggest only you plug app component in the index.html file

all other components can be plugged inside app component


every component is a piece of code that do not contain root element "html" or "head" or "body"
they contain only the portion of code that can be plugged into the app component or index.html

only index.html has the root elements


You learnt to create a component
plug it in app component

Binding
-------
property binding
		[]			one way binding		data in .ts is bound to the property of an element
event binding
		()
two way data binding
		[()]		banana in the box binding

	
Property binding:
	in typescript we declare a variable with a value
		x:string='hello world';
	in html
		{{x}}		this will print the value of x
	this is called as interpolation



    User Name: <input type="text" name="" id="" class="form-control" [value]="x">
		here, value is the property of text box which is bound to a variable in ts called "x"
	x is not a value, but variable declared in ts
	hence [] are used  to treat x as a variable

	Property binding is one way. The value of ts variable is used in the property of html element.
	But vice versa is not possible. a change in property will not change the ts variable at all

That is when you need 2 way data binding
Two way data binding:
	in order to do 2 way binding,
	1) import "FormsModule" in app.module.ts
	2) [()]
	3) the "name" property of the html element must be set for 2 way binding

Event binding
	binding a function to an event
